    <string name="about_para_1">Education is not preparation for life; education is life itself - rightly said by John Deway. \n\n Education is life and life is the right of each and every human living on the earth whether she/he is poor , rich or anyone . But due to lack of some resources , the so-called money , the so-called wealth , the poor section of our society is struggling for basic needs like education, food , shelter , clothing ,etc.
    And we as the responsible citizens of the country must bridge the gap between rich and poor . So to give this thought a direction, we have "SAPNE" , an NGO which is there to educate , to provide some basic requirements to the unprivileged section of children.</string>
    <string name="about_para_2">So, Sapne is working for the betterment of the children who do not know the real meaning of their life by analyzing their sapne , their dreams , we provide them the way to their dreams , we enlighten the way of their dreams. In this world , everyone dreams and everyone chase their respective dreams , so why can\'t these children ? They also have dreams and they also have right to fulfill their dreams and they must also know and hence we teach them that , " A dream is not that you see in sleep , dream is something that doesn\'t let you sleep."</string>
