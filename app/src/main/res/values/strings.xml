    <string name="short_lorem_ipsum">Her name is Sapna, a young girl who recently migrated to Delhi from Nepal, along with her parents. The first few months in Delhi were tough. Having little knowledge of Hindi, the common language, Sapna struggled to communicate with other kids of her dilapidated locality in Delhi. But not only does she share her name with our organisation, she shares SAPNE\'s grit and determination as well! Since the past three months, Sapnas been working diligently on her Hindi under the guidance of tutors provided by SAPNE. Her hardwork seems to be paying off and she can now converse and play with her friends with relative ease. During one of the career counselling sessions organised by SAPNE at her locality, Sapna shared her dream of becoming a doctor when she grows up. "I want to help the needy" she says with her trademark adorable smile. Help her fulfil her dreams.</string>

    <string name="medium_lorem_ipsum">"AJAY, a 26 year old boy suffering from EPILEPSY,a neurological disorder. He is a man of great inspiration for all of us. Ajay is so keen to get himself educated like all the other children. His innocence,dedication and hard work will not let him down. Despite facing the major problems he has in his life,his struggle fades all the other things that hinders the path of learning. He has that zeal to attain good and achieve best. We are very much involved into him by supporting his efforts. Are you? Help us so that we could provide him the best he wants."</string>

    <string name="long_lorem_ipsum">"Manpreet, despite belonging to a underprivileged section of the society is an integral part of SAPNE family and is no less than any of the so-called “rich children”. But due to some social and economic barriers, her dreams are somehow being neglected. She wants to adore her life and aspires to be a successful and respected teacher. Though, she has some learning disabilities and speech defects but, due to this, her dreams should not be shattered. So, we, with the help of our special educators are teaching her through the play-way method and hence she is edging towards her dreams."</string>
    <string name="about_para_1">Education is not preparation for life; education is life itself - rightly said by John Deway. \n\n Education is life and life is the right of each and every human living on the earth whether she/he is poor , rich or anyone . But due to lack of some resources , the so-called money , the so-called wealth , the poor section of our society is struggling for basic needs like education, food , shelter , clothing ,etc.
    And we as the responsible citizens of the country must bridge the gap between rich and poor . So to give this thought a direction, we have "SAPNE" , an NGO which is there to educate , to provide some basic requirements to the unprivileged section of children.</string>
    <string name="about_para_2">So, Sapne is working for the betterment of the children who do not know the real meaning of their life by analyzing their sapne , their dreams , we provide them the way to their dreams , we enlighten the way of their dreams. In this world , everyone dreams and everyone chase their respective dreams , so why can\'t these children ? They also have dreams and they also have right to fulfill their dreams and they must also know and hence we teach them that , " A dream is not that you see in sleep , dream is something that doesn\'t let you sleep."</string>
